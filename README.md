# The Ultimate Ditherizer
A tool that (hopefully) finds most optimal solutions to represent images in
limited color palettes.

## Current Features
None yet :-/

## Planned Features
I hope to write better detailed descriptions of these at some point...
* All dithering done in a perceptual color space (Oklab);\
  By far my main gripe with other programs.
* Global iterative error diffusion dithering;\
  Not just your standard Floyd-Steinberg
* (Hopefully) Better palette selection algorithms;\
  Also not just your standard K-means
  (which is quite flawed for this purpose,
   and so I hope to explain eventually...)
* Pallete conversion based on the Gale–Shapley algorithm
